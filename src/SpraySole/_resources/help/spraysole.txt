SpraySole Help

SpraySole is a library aimed at helping you create console driven applications.

Part of the project goals is providing the capabilities of SpraySole in a way that
are modular, reusable and tested. So, let's get started with using SpraySole.

    In all examples below the usage of SpraySole driven applications will use the
    console command `spraysole`. You may have aliased the execution of SpraySole's
    initialization script to some other command and should use that if appropriate.

1. Command line usage

    Bread and butter: spraysole --option cmd args

    It is intended that SpraySole commands should all be driven off the same
    overriding format. This will give consistency to your application's API and
    allow for easier parsing of input from the command line. The format for
    SpraySole commands is:

    spraysole [options...] <command-name> [args...]

    Let's take a look at each section of this format:

    `spraysole`

        This is the name of the console command powering your application. In these
        examples it is aliased to be 'spraysole' but may be something else on your
        system.

    `[options...]`

        This is zero or more option flags. Options flags are specially designated
        user input that starts with one or two dashes (-) followed immediately by
        the option name.
